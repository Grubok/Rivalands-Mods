# TransNumbers

TransNumbers My first mod and release. Created with intellij maven using Ago1024's Imported 0.20 sources and some other barbaric methods.
A Mod I've created for my server to move away from Direct code changes to aid in maintaining features between WU versions easier

The mod will modify the counter preset used to determine when using the transmute tile feature
The default is 100, changing it from this in the config file will set the new number as the target, it will also give relative responses to the new goal on inspect.
